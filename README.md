# Modus
A free chrome extension for task planning and execution, your way.

Modus—latin: *"way of doing"*—is inspired by an under-served niche in 
productivity apps: alleviating barriers to task-switching. With Modus, 
plan a sequence of tasks and receive gentle support to progress through 
them and achieve your goals.
